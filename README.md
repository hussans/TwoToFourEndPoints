**Project Name**: MiniChallengeTwoToFour - Endpoints
<br/>
**Description**: This project involves creating a simple API with three endpoints using ASP.NET Core. The first endpoint accepts two numbers, adds them together, and returns the sum in a sentence. The second endpoint asks for a user's name and wake-up time, then returns a sentence with the user's information. The third endpoint compares two numbers and outputs two sentences: one stating if the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second, and the other doing the same in reverse. Each endpoint has its own controller and service file, maintaining a clear separation between the HTTP request handling and business logic.
